Third-Degree Price Discrimination with OR – Summary
1. Concept

Third-degree price discrimination: charging different prices to different consumer groups based on their willingness to pay (WTP).

Real-world challenge: companies often don’t segment efficiently because:

Segmentation incurs costs (data, marketing, analysis).

Too many groups can reduce profitability.

Mispricing risks losing customers.

2. Key Problems to Solve

Optimal number of groups

Too few: leaves profit on the table.

Too many: high segmentation costs.

Pricing for each group

Maximize profit considering WTP distribution, group size, and segmentation costs.

Trade-offs

Revenue vs. segmentation cost.

Profit vs. customer satisfaction or fairness.

3. Operations Research (OR) Approach

Modeling the problem:

Decision variables: prices per group, number of groups.

Objective: maximize profit (revenue minus segmentation cost).

Constraints: budget for segmentation, demand limits, ethical/fairness rules.

Techniques to apply:

Linear / Nonlinear programming – optimize prices and group selection.

Stochastic modeling – incorporate uncertainty in demand.

Scenario analysis – test different segmentation strategies and costs.

Dynamic or time-based optimization – allow prices to adapt over time.

4. Enhancements for Creativity / Realism

Include segmentation costs explicitly in the model.

Incorporate uncertain or probabilistic demand.

Analyze dynamic pricing over time or multiple periods.

Build visualization or dashboard tools for decision support.

Optionally study welfare, fairness, or ethical impact.

5. Potential Data

Real-world datasets (airlines, SaaS, ride-sharing, online platforms) for demand and price variations.

Synthetic data can be generated if real data is unavailable.

6. Project Output

Optimized pricing strategy for multiple groups.

Trade-off analysis: profit vs. segmentation cost.

Scenario simulations showing how changes in demand or cost affect optimal prices.

Decision-support visualization for practical application.
